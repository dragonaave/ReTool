# ReTool
This project was created for easy use of mathematical / geometric rules and operations. This project contains a rebuild of all these operations.

Mathematical functions:

• rtl_pow - Raises the specified in the function argument. (x is the number to be raised to the power, y is the power to which we are raising)
• rtl_sqrt - Inverse square root. (x is the number from which we get the final result)
• rtl_ceil - Rounding off a number. (n is the number to be rounded)
