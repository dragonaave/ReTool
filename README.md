# ReTool
This project was created for easy use of mathematical / geometric rules and operations. This project contains a rebuild of all these operations.

Mathematical functions:

• rtl_pow - Raises the specified in the function argument. (x is the number to be raised to the power, y is the power to which we are raising)

• rtl_sqrt - Inverse square root. (x is the number from which we get the final result)

• rtl_cefl - Rounding off a number. (n is the number to be rounded)

• rtl_abs - Computes the absolute value of a floating point value arg. (x is the number to be absolute)
